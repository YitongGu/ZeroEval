There are 3 houses, numbered 1 to 3 from left to right, as seen from across the street. Each house is occupied by a different person. Each house has a unique attribute for each of the following characteristics:
 - Each person has a unique name: Peter, Eric, Arnold
 - Each person has a favorite color: red, white, yellow
 - Each mother is accompanied by their child: Fred, Meredith, Bella

## Clues:
1. Arnold is the person whose favorite color is red.
2. The person's child is named Fred is somewhere to the left of Eric.
3. The person whose favorite color is red is in the second house.
4. The person's child is named Bella is in the first house.
5. The person who loves white is the person's child is named Meredith.

We write the above clues in MiniZinc language:
enum Name = {Peter, Eric, Arnold};
enum Color = {red, white, yellow};
enum Child = {Fred, Meredith, Bella};
set of int: House = 1..3;

array[House] of var Name: name;
array[House] of var Color: color;
array[House] of var Child: child;

constraint forall(i in House, j in House) (i != j -> name[i] != name[j]);
constraint forall(i in House, j in House) (i != j -> color[i] != color[j]);
constraint forall(i in House, j in House) (i != j -> child[i] != child[j]);
constraint forall(i in House) (name[i] == Arnold -> color[i] == red);
constraint forall(i in House) (child[i] == Fred -> (i < 3 /\ name[i+1] == Eric));
constraint color[2] == red;
constraint child[1] == Bella;
constraint forall(i in House) (color[i] == white -> child[i] == Meredith);
